# FlashCards Starter Kit

## Abstract
This project allows the user to play a trivia game in the console. For each question, the user is presented with three possible answers. The user selects an answer and the console tells the user whether they answered correctly or incorrectly. After all questions have been asked, the application informs the user of the percentage of correct answers made.
